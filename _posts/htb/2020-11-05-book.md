## Enumeration

Add `book` to `hosts` and start an `nmap` scan.

### Nmap

Couldn't find anything interesting on port `22`. Lets proceed to port `80`.

We have a web app with a login page. I tried out some injections and bypass methods, but all failed. We can use the sign up feature to create a new user and login.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/book/login.png){: .align-center}
    
The interface provides plethora of possible attack vectors. I tried exploiting file upload and and a possible `LFI`, but none of that worked. Then I found something interesting looking at the contact page.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/book/contact.png){: .align-center}
    
We have  an admin user with the email `admin@book.htb`. The message in settings and the email points out that there is probably an admin interface.

### Dirb

kali@kali:~$ dirb http://book.htb

```

So we have an admin login page, but no credentials or any way to bypass. I tried registering a user with `admin@book.htb` as the email in the signup page, but it was throwing the error user exits. 

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/book/exists.gif){: .align-center}
    
    
### Admin Bypass    
I was stuck here for a long time. After going through the forum, I spotted couple of odd stuff.

1. There is a limit for the length of email and name. We can see some client code related to this.
```javascript
    function validateForm() {
      var x = document.forms["myForm"]["name"].value;
      var y = document.forms["myForm"]["email"].value;
      if (x == "") {
        alert("Please fill name field. Should not be more than 10 characters");
        return false;
      }
      if (y == "") {
        alert("Please fill email field. Should not be more than 20 characters");
        return false;
      }
    }
```
2. If the name or email is longer than 20 characters, it truncates it at 20 characters. This can be observer if you create a user with a mail longer than 20 characters. 

The string `admin@book.htb` is 14 characters long. So what will happen if we bypass client side restriction and register with email admin@book.htb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q. The system will `truncate` the user to 10 characters and we can register as `admin` overwriting the current `admin` password. And then we can login to `admin` panel.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/book/admin.gif){: .align-center}
    
There is some kind of cleanup that is happening in the background. So you have to act fast, or the credentials become invalid.


### SSRF via XSS in PDF 

There is an option in `admin` panel to export the list of collections. This also contains the collections that are uploaded by user for moderation. I noticed that the attacker controlled fields `title` and `author` gets reflected in the `PDF`. 

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/book/pdf.png){: .align-center}

This [blog](https://www.noob.ninja/2017/11/local-file-read-via-xss-in-dynamically.html) talks in detail about a very interesting `SSRF` attack using `XSS` in `PDF`. 

The summary of the blog is that if our input is reflected in the `PDF` then We can inject custom `script` in the field to read local files. The following code can be used to read the `/etc/passwd` file.

```javascript
 <script> x=new XMLHttpRequest; x.onload=function(){ document.write(this.responseText) }; x.open("GET","file:///etc.passwd"); x.send(); </script>
```

Inspecting the output `PDF`, we can see the `passwd` file.

## Low Shell

There is a user named `reader`. Lets try reading the `ssh` keys using the same vector.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/htbimg/book/sshkeys.gif){: .align-center}
    
And we have the `ssh` key. We can now login as `reader`.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/book$ ssh -i id_rsa reader@book.htb

```

`lograte` has a [privilege escalation](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47466) vulnerability. We can use this to get `root`. One requirement of this exploit is to know the log path. There is a folder named `backup` in our `home` directory. I had to look through the forum to confirm this was the right one. 

We can use two methods as payload.

1. Write a ssh key to `/authorized_keys`  in `root` folder.
2. Use a reverse shell as the payload.

The first one is more stable.

```bash
reader@book:~$ ./log -p payload /home/reader/backups/access.log
Waiting for rotating /home/reader/backups/access.log...
Renamed /home/reader/backups with /home/reader/backups2 and created symlink to /etc/bash_completion.d
Waiting 1 seconds before writing payload...
Done!
```
I had to manually change the `access.log` file to trigger the exploit. You can also re login to `reader` from another window to trigger it.

SSH into the box as `root`

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/htb/book$ ssh -i id_rsa_n root@book.htb
