### [Exploit Education Level 9](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-09/)

## Challenge
There is a C setuid wrapper for some vulnerable PHP code.  
To do this level, log in as the `level09` account with the password `level09`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag09`.  
Taking a look at the code,it is possible to identify some calls to the preg_replace, whose function is to replace content in a
string based on a regular expression. The first preg_replace will basically replace all the “.” by “dot” and all the “@” by “AT”. 
The last two preg_replace will replace the square brackets by the angle quotes.

If you feed some file to this program, `flag09` will analyze and replace all `“@”` and `“.”` symbols. At the end, will print to the command line the entire file sanitized.

For example, the following image contains the output of running flag09 with some file containing `“[abc@gmail.com]”`.
```bash
level09@nebula:~$ /home/flag09/flag09 arg
PHP Notice:  Undefined offset: 2 in /home/flag09/flag09.php on line 22
abc AT gmail dot com
```
## Vulnerability
The vulnerability is in the following line
```php
$contents = preg_replace("/(\[email (.*)\])/e", "spam(\"\\2\")", $contents);
```
In order to get a shell, we can place in the file `“[email {${system(sh)}}]”` instead of the last string.
This because `PHP` will try to evaluate the expression due to the `/e` tag
