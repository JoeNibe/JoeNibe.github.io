### [Exploit Education Level 5](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-05/)

## Challenge
Check the `flag05` home directory. You are looking for weak directory permissions
To do this level, log in as the `level05` account with the password `level05`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag05`.
## Vulnerability
The backup file has read permissions.
This is a pem key. We can convert it into a `ppk` key and ssh using putty and authenticate using `ppk` key.
[How to convert](https://www.puttygen.com/convert-pem-to-ppk)
## Solution
Lets connect to ssh using the `ppk` key

Once the .pem file is converted .ppk then users can connect to remote hosts using PuTTY’s SSH client. Below are steps to launch a PuTTY session.

1. First, open PuTTY and input the host IP address. Please note that an SSL VPN connection must be established if the connection is to with 10.X private address.
2. Now, from the category pane, navigate to Connection and expand SSH and the Auth.
3. Click on ‘Browse’ and select the newly converted .ppk file, that was generated using PuTTYgen.
4. Now to commence the PuTTY session, choose the option ‘open.’

```
login as: flag05
