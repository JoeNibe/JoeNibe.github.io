### [Exploit Education Level 6](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-06/)

## Challenge
The `flag06` account credentials came from a legacy unix system.

To do this level, log in as the `level06` account with the password `level06`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag06`.

## Vulnerability
It is mentioned that the user account was created using a legacy unix system.
In older systems the account passwords used to be saved in the `/etc/passwd` file and was encrypted using a 
weak algorithm (DES Algorithm)

Lets look at the passwd file
``` bash
level06@nebula:/etc$ cat passwd | grep flag06
flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh
```
And we can see the username and an encrypted password. Lets copy it into a file named `p.john` and try cracking it 
using [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)
``` bash
C:> .\john.exe 'p.john'
Warning: detected hash type "descrypt", but the string is also recognized as "descrypt-opencl"
Use the "--format=descrypt-opencl" option to force loading these as that type instead
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (descrypt, traditional crypt(3) [DES 256/256 AVX2])
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Proceeding with single, rules:Single
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
Almost done: Processing the remaining buffered candidate passwords, if any.
Warning: Only 642 candidates buffered for the current salt, minimum 1024 needed for performance.
Proceeding with wordlist:/run/password.lst, rules:Wordlist
hello            (flag06) //Password and Username

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```
And it was cracked quickly since it was using a weak algorithm and a even more weaker password

Lets login using these credentials

``` bash
level06@nebula:/etc$ su - flag06
Password:
flag06@nebula:~$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
### Solved!
